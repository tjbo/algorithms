// a stack is a data structure where the last thing
// to get added will be the first thing to be removed
// as long as you only use push & pop on an array, it will be a stack
// or if you only used unshfit & shift
// pop and push are more efficient, since the
// array is not re-indexed
// LIFO = last in, first out

const stack = []

stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
